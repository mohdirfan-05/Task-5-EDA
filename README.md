# Exploratory Data Analysis – Titanic Dataset 🚢📊

## 📌 Objective

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the data using visual and statistical methods. This project demonstrates the application of data analysis tools and the interpretation of insights for real-world datasets.

## 📁 Project Files

- `task_5_eda_titanic.ipynb` – Colab notebook with EDA code and visualizations
- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset used for analysis
- `EDA_Report.pdf` – PDF report exported from the notebook, including visual insights and summary
- `README.md` – Description and structure of the project

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Key Analytical Tasks

- Data inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Handling missing values and skewed distributions
- Univariate analysis (distribution of Age, Fare, Survival, etc.)
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis (e.g., Sex vs Survival, class distribution)
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps and pairplots
- Outlier detection using boxplots

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest likelihood of survival.
- Age distribution was slightly skewed and handled via median imputation.
- Fare showed correlation with both class and survival.
- Some features like cabin had high missing values and were excluded from core analysis.
